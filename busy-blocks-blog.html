              The clock ticked to 6:20 PM signaling to everyone that class was
              finally over. The class slowly shuffled outside into the crisp,
              spring, evening air. Excited chatter began to fill the open space
              outside of the classrooms in Pepper Canyon Hall. One of my friends
              looks over and says "I've got a great idea for this class" and the
              rest was history.
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text left-align intro">
              The idea as it was pitched was a website that integrated a calendar
              feature with a social media aspect. It would give the user the
              ability to plan group events with ease as it would overlay multiple
              users' calendars in order to find free time among a group. Users
              would also be able to friend other users and share their schedules.
              I wasn't immediately on board with the idea as it seemed a little excessive
              but I thought it would be a great project to work on in my free time.
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text left-align intro">
              The team was eventually settled upon with a majority of the members
              being my roommates, neighbors, and friends. We all decided to get some
              dinner and pick a team name that best describes us. One of my teammates
              began choosing random pop culture terms and jokingly expanded the letters
              into various phrases. We laughed until he came up with the perfect name.
              Henceforth, we branded ourselves as <b>Team HIPSTER</b> -
              (Humans in Programming, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Research)
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text left-align intro">
              As a part of the course (CSE 110), each member of the group was
              assigned a job title which correlated to the work they did on the
              team. My title was <b>Software Engineer Lead</b>. I chose this
              position  because I felt like I had a lot of web development
              experience at the time and my time would best be used managing others
              and getting high level functionality working. This also let me have a say
              in all decisions made about the application as a whole. One of my core
              responsibilities was to make and present the <i>System Requirements</i>
              document. This document outlined the functionality of the web app by
              detailing what the system shall and shall not do in various scenarios.
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text left-align intro">
              Unfortunately, with only 10 weeks, not everyone was able to directly
              contribute to the programming of the website. Three other teammates
              and I devoted our time to the code while the other seven members
              worked on the documentation. As the quarter came to an end, I couldn't
              help but feel accomplished by how many new technologies I had learned:
              AngularJS, Parse, Git, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text left-align intro">
              At the end of quarter, we made a video to highlight the feataures of
              our webapp. We presented to our discussion group of three other teams
              and won with the most votes. We moved up to the class tier and
              presented against the winners of the other discussion groups. Here,
              we came in <b>4th</b> place of the 16 teams.
