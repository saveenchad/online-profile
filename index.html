              A little bit about me: I'm <span id="age"></span> years old, born

              in a web dev environment with a focus on UI and UX. I am proficient
              in a myriad of languages including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery,
              AngularJS, and Bootstrap.

              Currently, I'm looking to gain more experience in the web dev field.
              I want to eventually become proficient with more backend technologies

						    		FoodTime, created during a 12 hour hackathon, is a website dedicated to making the lives of UCSD students easier. This project displays all the food items located in each of the dining halls in a quick and user friendly format.
						    	</p>
						    	<p>
						    		FoodTime uses JSON to read the official menus on the UCSD Dining website. It creates a side bar menu using each item listed and dynamically changes each day.
						    	</p>
						    	<p>
						    		Unfortunately, the project is not finished. The plan is to make the full menu be stored in cache so that one look at the beginning of the day is all that is needed to be informed of the food options around campus. And subsequent looks can be made offline. We also want to provide pictures, description, nutritional facts, and helpful reviews by other students for each item. To do this, we plan to use SQL to create a database

									The Food Ave. application was my first project. I created this after my first programming class in community college. It replicated the GUI that I used while working at Target.
								</p>
								<p>
									This project uses SQL to read one table in a Microsoft Access file to login to the system, and reads another table to display the selected items and prices in a list view. You can also add new users to be able to login, void single items from the list, void all the items from the list, and even input valid coupons which is accomplished by reading another table.
								</p>
								<p>
									This is by far my most favorite project because it opened my eyes to the world of programming. By creating this, I wanted to learn more and add more to the user experience.

						    		The Matrix animation is another one of my more favorite programs that I have written. This is because I had this idea for a couple of days. After thinking about the process that it would take, I wrote a generic version that wasn't nearly as visually appeasing.
						    	</p>
						    	<p>
						    		I did some research and patched up the code and eventually got the final product. It amazes me how in the span of one week, I went from an idea to a finished product that I could dynamically change to my liking.

					          Beep is a parking aid app designed for UCSD students. I thought
                    of the idea while struggling to find parking before my classes.

                    While taking COGS 187a, my team and I were able to make mockups,
                    and research need finding and personas in potential users. We recorded
                    the journey using Medium. Through the class, we got multiple professors
                    hooked on our idea and they encouraged us to fully develop the app after
                    the class was over.
						    	</p>
                  <p>
                    The plan is to fully implement the app within the next year :D

					          One of the projects I've been interested in for a long time is the
                    magic mirror. They way this works is that a two-way mirror is positioned
                    above a monitor with a black screen and custom white text. Since a
                    two-way mirror is used, when there is black behind it, the mirror is just
                    a normal mirror. With light behind it (our side), it becomes transparent
                    like glass.
						    	</p>
						    	<p>
                    Unfortunately, all the individual pieces that make up the magic
                    mirror cost a lot of money so this project has been in the backlogs
                    for a while :'(. But hopefully, I can work on it after graduating.

					          With Parse ending it's services in January 2017, one of the projects
                    I wanted to work on over the summer was to convert Busy Block's
                    backend from using Parse's database services to Mongo's database services.

                    Along with that, our front end was exclusively written in AngularJS, and i
                    would like to upgrade it to using a MEAN stack architecture to make it
                    easier to maintain and add functionality to.
